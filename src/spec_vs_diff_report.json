  "summary": "The diff only modifies `project_state.json` and does not show any frontend code or asset changes removing or de-referencing `download.webp`. Both requested requirements appear unimplemented. Additionally, the modified project summary mentions an \"Ongoing Projects\" page, which is unrelated to the request to remove `download.webp`.",

      "reason": "No frontend page/component or image list changes are present in the diff; only `project_state.json` was modified, so there is no evidence that UI references to `download.webp` were removed.",
