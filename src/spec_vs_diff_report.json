  "summary": "MajorProjectsPage was updated to render a featured hero image between the intro block and the projects grid with appropriate styling and alt text. However, the required static image asset file itself was not added to the frontend public assets in this diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Add the new Major Projects featured image as a static asset under the public assets path so it can be referenced by the Major Projects page via an absolute path (e.g., \"/assets/generated/...\"), without routing the image through the backend.",
      "reason": "The page references \"/assets/generated/major-projects-hero.dim_1600x900.jpg\", but the diff shows no added files, so the required image file is not present under the public assets/generated folder in this change set.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"ADDED FILES: - none\"",
