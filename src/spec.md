# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the specific uploaded image asset `download.webp` from the BM ENTERPRISES website so it is not displayed or shipped with the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all UI references to `download.webp` across pages/sections (including any galleries or featured image lists).
- Delete the `download.webp` static asset from the frontend only after confirming it is no longer referenced anywhere.
- Ensure the site builds and renders without broken image links.

**User-visible outcome:** The website no longer shows the `download.webp` image anywhere, and there are no broken/missing image placeholders.
