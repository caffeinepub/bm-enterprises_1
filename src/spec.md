# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a prominent featured image section to the Major Projects page ("/projects") with styling consistent with other site pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a responsive featured image block between the page title/intro content and the projects grid on the "/projects" page (full width, max-w-5xl, centered, rounded corners, shadow, object-cover).
- Add the featured image as a static public asset and reference it via an absolute path from the Major Projects page.
- Provide an English alt text describing the featured image content while keeping the rest of the projects layout unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting "/projects" shows a styled featured image between the intro text and the project cards, with the existing projects grid otherwise unchanged.
